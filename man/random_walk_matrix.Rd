\title{Generate a random walk matrix}
\usage{
random_walk_matrix(size, start, steps)
}
\arguments{
\item{size}{Integer. Size of the square matrix (n x n).}

\item{start}{Integer. Starting point or initial state in the matrix (1-based index).}

\item{steps}{List of numeric vectors. Each vector represents probabilities of moving to the next state from each current state.}
}
\value{
A square matrix where each element represents the probability of transitioning from one state to another.
}
\description{
This function generates a random walk matrix based on a given starting point and step probabilities.
Random walks are essential in modeling processes where outcomes are influenced by probabilistic steps or transitions. This function allows for simulating such processes over a matrix structure.
}
\examples{
# Generate a random walk matrix for a 3x3 matrix
walk_matrix <- random_walk_matrix(size = 3, start = 1, steps = list(c(0.3, 0.5, 0.2), c(0.4, 0.1, 0.5), c(0.2, 0.6, 0.2)))
print(walk_matrix)
